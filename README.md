# VASAseq_2022

This repository aims to serve as an index of the main computational methods implemented in VASA-seq's manuscript (Salmen &amp; De Jonghe et al. 2022). The computational work carried out in this manuscript can be into two main modules, which are focused on (I) Gene expression and (II) Alternative splicing analyses. 

## I. Gene expression analyses
All the scripts and descriptions of methods used to perform quantitative analyses based on gene expression profiles extracted from VASA-seq and other scRNA-seq experiments can be found at the followin
