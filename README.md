# Index of computational methods used for VASA-seq manuscript



This repository aims to serve as an index of the main computational methods implemented in VASA-seq's manuscript (Salmen &amp; De Jonghe et al. 2022). The computational work carried out in this manuscript can be divided into two main modules focused on (I) Gene expression and (II) Alternative splicing analyses. Each of these modules has several sub-sections, where corresponding material and descriptions are contained across the folders present in this repository.
