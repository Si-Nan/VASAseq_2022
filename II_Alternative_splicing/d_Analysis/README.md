# Overview

Scripts used to analyse the alternative splicing results were implemented as Jupyter and Rstudio notebooks. This folder contains all the notebooks used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript. These results can be visualised across the HTML files, which stored the output of each excecuted chunk of code.
