# II. Alternative splicing analyses


To perform a deep characterisation of known and novel alternative splicing events we performed a reference guided transcriptome assemby and splicing quantifiaction inegrating three main computational worflows (StringTie2, MicroExonator and Whippet) and several in-house scripts. Overall desing the data analyses we conducted are represented in the following workflow chart:
