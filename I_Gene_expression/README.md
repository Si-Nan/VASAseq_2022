# I. Gene expression analyses

To quantify gene expression across cells we developed a in-house pipeline to map reads from VASA-seq, 10x and Smarth seque data. The full description of this pipeline can be found at the [a_Mapping](a_Mapping) folder. All the remaining scripts used during downstream analyses can be found at [b_Analysis](b_Analysis).
